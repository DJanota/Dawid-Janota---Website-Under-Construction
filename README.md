# Dawid-Janota---Website-Under-Construction
Dawid Janota - Website Under Construction is a project aimed at informing users that the right site is under construction and will soon appear. In the project I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript technologies with the jQuery 3.3.1 library with the help of which I created a time counting clock and modal box. In addition, I used the Bootstrap 4.1.3 web framework. I used Font Awesome for the font script. In order to get information about website traffic, I implemented the Google Analitics script. In addition, the site uses Google Tag Manager.
